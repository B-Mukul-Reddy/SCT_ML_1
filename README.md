House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Overview
This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, full bathrooms, and half bathrooms. We use two datasets: one containing the features of the houses (square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.) and the other containing the target variable (house prices). The project demonstrates data preprocessing, splitting data into training and testing sets, training the linear regression model, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

The project steps include:
Data Loading: Load datasets containing features and house prices.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and select relevant features.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training set.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using various metrics and visualize the results.
Visualization: Create plots for model performance and feature importance.
